	<h1 class="one">What IS The PROBLEM?</h1>
	<p class="two">Many issues need to spread rapidly amongst the<br> community. But instead of facing these issues and <br>helping them get across, the news decides to spread<br> fake news or news that may harm our society. <br>Why is that?</p>
	<h2>Before we start with the problem, let's take a look at why this issue is important.</h2>

	<button type="button" class="collapsible">What can it cause?</button>
<div class="content">

<ol class="three">
	<li>It can severely damage the credibility of news reports.
	 <ul>-Reporting truths is the meaning of news and how it gains credibility. Because of this, most news stations value the authenticity of their news, even if it is to give up its timeliness.</ul></li>
	<li>It can cause serious damages to the reputation, image and rights of the person reported.
		<ul>-Not only does fake news cause harm to the reputation and public image of the media, but it also cause severe damage to the public perception, reputation, mental health, financial and even physical health of the person reported.</ul></li>
	<li>It damages the value of real news and good news
		<ul>-Just like how having more fake diploma will make the value of real diploma go down; if fake news are all over, the worth of honest, good news will be lowered. Once the worth of news decreases, the social status and the value of reporters and media will eventually subside.</ul></li>
	<li>It can bring chaosin the community
		<ul>-It wouldn't be such a significant problem if fake news only affects the media and the person reported. But in fact, some fake news can result in absolute chaos in the social order of one's society.</ul></li></ol></div>

<div class="content"> 
	<ol class='three'>
	  <li>For advertisements:
	  	<ul>-The media spends time and effort to make news reports; the readers pay small amounts of money to the media. While they read/watch the news flash, they would also see advertisements. After they gathered attention from the readers, they will continue to hand more money to the media in order to advertise their products.<br>
For the media to survive, they must have enough advertisers; for the media to have many advertisers, they must have many readers.  There are only so many eyes in a country, but plentiful media needs to depend on them to live. When this happens, a destructive competition occurs. 
<br>
To grab the readers' attention, they would try to make 'explosive contents', but only that much occurs in the world, there are only so many events that can be reported. So, they would start creating FALSE NEWS. They come up with fake stories, saying they have exclusives; while the truth is, it is fake.  </ul>
</li>
<br>
<li>The conditions of labour is not well:
<ul>-At times, news reporters have to hand out eight reports a day; when there are only approximately eight work hours per day. In order to create a news report, you must:
<li>pick your topic,</li>
<li>research the information,</li>
<li>interview,</li>
<li>verify the information,</li>
<li>write the news flash </li>
<li>some even have to edit their videos.</li>
-All the above mentioned have not even included the time it takes for transportation. There are so much the reporters have to do, while they have so little time to do them. This results in some of them taking information straight from articles of social media, not verifying the news at all.</ul></li>
<br>
<li>Those who loves reading it are those who despise it most:
<ul>
	-Let's say you took it in, and despite what the conditions are like, you made a truthful, magnificent report. But in the end, you realize the page view of your story is not even as high as clickbaity fake news. This phenomenon would eventually lower the reporter's will to writing real news which takes a lot of their time.
</ul></li>
<br>
<li>Consortiums dominate the media and use them for personal purposes:
	<ul>
		-Operating media can take a large amount of money. One SNG vehicle costs at least 100 000 dollars, not to say those satellites that need to be maintained every once in a while. Some say that operating a media is like throwing a "Mercedes-Benz" into the ocean every day. The incredibly high demand for running a news company blocks out those who have the greatest ideals and leaves the news industry with consortiums. These merchants buy or start a media not to speak for the weak, not to supervise the government, not to spread the truth and not to promote social dialogue. But instead, they would use these media to promote their products and those politics who would benefit them more.

	<button type="button" class="collapsible">How can we identify fake news?</button>
<div class="content"> 
	<h3>Just like how there are food labels on edible products, there are product labels for news as well. Spotting fake news is very simple.Just like how you won't buy milk with a questionable source, if there is one item is unclear, do not trust it!Here are some simple ways you can spot real and fake news:</h3>
	<ol class='three'>
<li>Which media? </li>
<li>Whose media?
<ul>-usually found in the "about us" section of the website. If it is nowhere to be seen, there is a big possibility that it is fake.</ul></li>
<li>Who wrote this report?</li>
<li>Who gave this information?
<ul>-It is essential to know 3 and 4. We often see news beginning with "According to informed resources..." or "According to leaked information..."
Whom is it according to? What are they trying to hide? The principle is simple. Unless you are from the mafia, reporter for a communist country or those that when exposed, can make your self in danger. Or else when you come across reports which lack transparency, unfrank or is trying to cover up something; do NOT believe it, because no one will be responsible for what they said.</ul></li>
<li>When did this happen?</li>
<li>Where did this take place?
<ul>-We won't buy expired or food with questionable sources. Then in the same concept, we should not believe news which overuses old information and has a dubious resource. </ul></li>
