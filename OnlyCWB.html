	<p class="two">Many issues need to spread rapidly amongst the<br> community. But instead of facing these issues and <br>helping them get across, the news decides to spread<br> fake news or news that may harm our society. <br>Why is that?</p>
	<h2>Before we start with the problem, let's take a look at why this issue is important.</h2>

<h3>What can it cause?</h3>
<ol class="three">
	<li>It can severely damage the credibility of news reports.
	 <ul>-Reporting truths is the meaning of news and how it gains credibility. Because of this, most news stations value the authenticity of their news, even if it is to give up its timeliness.</ul></li>
	<li>It can cause serious damages to the reputation, image and rights of the person reported.
		<ul>-Not only does fake news cause harm to the reputation and public image of the media, but it also cause severe damage to the public perception, reputation, mental health, financial and even physical health of the person reported.</ul></li>
	<li>It damages the value of real news and good news</li>
	<li>It can bring chaosin the community
		<ul>-It wouldn't be such a significant problem if fake news only affects the media and the person reported. But in fact, some fake news can result in absolute chaos in the social order of one's society.</ul></li>
